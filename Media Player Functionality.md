In order to play the songs in media player first select any song from the playlist. 
Secondly click on the name of the singer adjacent to it in order to get the thumbnail of the song.
 
 NOTE:
 If you click on next or previous buttons then only particular song will be played because it is hard coded 
 else you can click any random song from playlist.
 
 If you want to pause a song, first sync the pause button with music bar pause, until that is done the functionality won't work.
 
 If you have any problems do let me know.
